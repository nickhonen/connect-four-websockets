## Websockets Project

mostly followed the tutorial on the [websockets docs](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/tutorial1.html),
tried to do everything myself. Most likely will add real time chat and some other things that I do completely myself. Been wanting to learn this for a while.
