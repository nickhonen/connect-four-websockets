## Websockets Project

mostly followed the tutorial on the [websockets docs](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/tutorial1.html),
tried to do everything myself. Most likely will add real time chat and some other things that I do completely myself. Been wanting to learn this for a while.

## hosted frontend

Hosted on fly.io, link tbd.

## TODO

- [ ] make people make usernames
- [ ] add message when people join and who youre playing. Welc
- [ ] add real time chat (all chat)
- [ ] add spectator mode
- [ ] add way to actually click join link and have that generate room
- [ ] (or instead of doing that just add a button to copy link to the clipboard)
- [ ] setup github actions ci/cd (real stretch goal)
- [ ] win counter? (also real stretch goal and would need a db)
